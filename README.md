### Segmentation

Playing around with segmentation computer vision algorithms. This repo is a bit messy!

I've been learning about the Kuwahara filtering algorithm. Very cool! It's a bit obscure, so Claude has been less helpful, but it's still been useful in guiding my learning and as a coding buddy.

This has been a great project. Since Oct 6, I feel like I've learnt so much in terms of image processing, computer vision, and unsupervised learning algorithms.

Right now I'm working on SLIC.ipynb, but the other notebooks display a record of my experimentation with various computer vision algorithms.

The experience so far has been insightful. With a lot of these difficult problems - segmenting complex images into nicely divided portions that makes sense to humans, in particular - clarity of thought is key. There's an initial research phase, which for me involves mostly using Claude and watching relevant youtube videos. At the same time, I like to experiment with actual python code and libraries - Jupyter Notebook has been such a great tool, as it makes it so easy to just execute Python and see what manipulations you are doing to the data. 

Through discussions with Claude and experimentation, I found SLIC to be a very promising image segmentation algorithm for our purposes. After learning how it works and messing with the parameters and visualizating the various segments it generates, I am now digging a bit deeper into the algorithm itself, using Claude to generate Python implementing it, and carefully reviewing it and correcting mistakes. Hopefully we can improve this image segmentation more and more for our images.
